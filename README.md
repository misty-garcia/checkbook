# This is my checkbook application built in python and run via the command line. 
# To begin the program, a 4-digit username is requested. 
# Any numeric username will suffice, as a new transaction and balance sheet will be created for the associated username. 
# If you wish to see an account with transactions already populated, select username '1111'. 
# Type '6' in the home menu or 'exit' in any user-input menu to exit the program.
